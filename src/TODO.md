*Notes on the code merger - 2025-02-17*

Arjun:

The two code bases principally touch in main.py. From there they go their separate ways. 

The code for your summaries uses:
* `main.py` -> bot.slash_command 
           -> (summary.py) summary(), fromtosummary() or unreadsummary()

The code for webhook summaries uses:
* `main.py` -> wires `summary_for_webhook()` into a Flask controlled by `webhook.py`
            -> (history.py) `summarize_contents_of_channel_between_dates()`  uses `get_channel_messages()` followed by progressive calls to `get_summary_from_ai()`. To minimize costs, call return values are cached in the LRUCache.
            `
            `webhook.py` `webhook()` receives the POST and will forward the response (and embedded request) using `send_message_to_webhook()` according to the values in the incoming payload





*Refactoring* 
Your code could use summarize_contents_of_channel_between_dates in the sections for collection from history:
```
 async for message in channel.history(limit=None):
        if first:
            first = False
            continue

        history.append(message)

        if len(history) == messages:
            break
```

Line #88-96 (summary)
Line #168-183 (fromtosummary)
Line #205-222 (unreadsummary)

If so, the hardcoded html would need reworking (e.g. line #26 of history.py)


My code has global values for:
* OPEN API KEY
 * Currently an environment varible
 * I'm thinking this could be passed in the incoming payload (and omitted outbound)
* context_lookback_days
 * the context window provides background info to aid with interpretation in addition to the period being summarized
 * Set to 5, but already can be provided in the payload
* Some HTML in response strings (for things like headers)
